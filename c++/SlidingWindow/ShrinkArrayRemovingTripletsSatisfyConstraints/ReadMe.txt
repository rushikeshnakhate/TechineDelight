Shrink an array by removing triplets that satisfy given constraints
Given an integer array, shrink it by removing adjacent triplets that satisfy the given constraints and return the total number of elements in the resultant array.

A triplet (x, y, z) can only be removed if, for a given number k, the second element y of the triplet is precise k more than the first element x. The third element, z, is precise k more than the second element y. The total number of elements in the final array should be as few as possible.


For example,

Input:  A[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8], k = 2

Output: 3

The adjacent triplet (3, 5, 7) can be removed from the array. The resultant array is [1, 7, 8] cannot be reduced further.


Input:  A[] = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], k = 1

Output: 0

The result is 0 since we can remove all elements from the array. First, the adjacent triplet (2, 3, 4) is removed. The array is now reduced to [-1, 0, 1], which forms another valid triplet and can be removed from the array.

Note that if the adjacent triplet (1, 2, 3) is removed from the array first, we cannot reduce the resultant array [-1, 0, 4] further.
