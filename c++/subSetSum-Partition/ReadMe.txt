Partition Problem using Dynamic Programming
Given a set of positive integers, check if it can be divided into two subsets with equal sum.

For example,

Consider S = {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1}

We can partition S into two partitions, each having a sum of 5.

S1 = {1, 1, 1, 2}
S2 = {2, 3}

Note that this solution is not unique. Hereâ€™s another solution.

S1 = {3, 1, 1}
S2 = {2, 2, 1}
