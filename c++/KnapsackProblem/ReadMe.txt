In the 0â€“1 Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

Please note that the items are indivisible; we can either take an item or not (0-1 property). For example,

Input:

value = [ 20, 5, 10, 40, 15, 25 ]
weight = [ 1, 2, 3, 8, 7, 4 ]
int W = 10

Output: Knapsack value is 60

value = 20 + 40 = 60
weight = 1 + 8 = 9 < W
